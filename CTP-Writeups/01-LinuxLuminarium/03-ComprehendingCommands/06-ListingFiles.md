# Listing Files
type what the challenge asks

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{MIzNFoh2HuxNe5ydadksTmAXmBC.QX4IDO0wSN3AzNzEzW}`

`ls` lists the files and folders in the CWD.
Alternatively you can provide an argument, and `ls` will list the files and folders in that argument folder.
```bash
hacker@commands~listing-files:~$ ls /challenge/
20290-renamed-run-6224  DESCRIPTION.md
hacker@commands~listing-files:~$ /challenge/20290-renamed-run-6224 
Yahaha, you found me! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{MIzNFoh2HuxNe5ydadksTmAXmBC.QX4IDO0wSN3AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
The `ls` command.
