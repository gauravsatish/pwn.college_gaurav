# Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called **-** located in the home directory. Read it.

# Solve
**Password:** `263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx`

Many utilities interpret `-` as the beginning of an argument, so to refer to a file we can use its absolute or relative path. If the file is in the `CWD`, then we prepend it with a `./`

```bash
cat ./-
```

```console
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat ./-
263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx
