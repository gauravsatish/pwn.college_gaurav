# Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called `--spaces in this filename--` located in the home directory. Read it.

# Solve
**Password:** `MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx`

Similar to the previous level, `--` is also used to denote arguments, normally in the fullform/expanded form. To avoid this we can do: (prepending with `./`)

```bash
cat "./--spaces in this filename--" 
# OR
cat ./--spaces\ in\ this\ filename-- 
```

```console
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat "./--spaces in this filename--" 
MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx
```
